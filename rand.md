  - seed = nanoTime xor 0x5DEECE66DL & 0b100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
- bounded rand int (even bound)
  - next 31 bits
  - `bound * (31 bits) >> 31`
  - only keeps the 5 left most bits
```java
int next() { // ignored parameter for this specific case
    do {
        current = seed.get();
        new_seed = (current * 0x5DEECE66DL + 0xB) & 0x800000000000;
    } while (current == new_seed);
    return (new_seed >>> (48 - 31)); // seed unsigned bit shifted
}
```
